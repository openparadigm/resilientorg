# AboutFor a long time, companies have been operating within a top down hierarchical model which gets less and less effective nowadays - in times of constant transitions, disruptions and change. A desperate need for a new model is becoming more and more apparent.Multiple attempts to tweak the existing model by introducing "flat" organizations (minimizing or even removing hierarchical structures) or by separating management from technical/expert leadership. None of these approaches were successful in large organizations or endured over an extended period of time.We see people becoming increasingly demotivated and disengaged within conventional organizations which are continuously become more dysfunctional.The primary reason for this the disregard for the human factor - people's natural qualities and needs that are not accounted for by the conventional approach. All employees: smart and not so smart, strong and weak, ambitious and complacent, innovative and conservative are all being painted with the same brush and made to fight individually for survival.Strong and ambitious make it to the top, but are they the smart, empathetic and innovative ones? Rarely...In the end, real success comes only with the right leadership, expertise, connection and spirit within individual teams and companies overall. That's what brings resilience to efforts that people pursue and accomplish. So what are the real factors of success that few of these leaders and companies possess?The answer is simple - success comes from operating in two dimensions.1. Expertise organized in a reasonable, hierarchical manner - somebody still needs to make decisions and keep order to avoid anarchy and loss of focus.2. A social bottom-up aspect - making every member of a team/organization feel like members of one family and not just small cogwheels in a big machine.By having this social aspect in place, the few who have figured it out managed to make average people find their right place and excel in what they were previously not capable of.Today, we call this aspect "Corporate Culture" - such a cold and soulless description for something so warm and secure.The goal of this project, is to define in a non-HR language what "culture" really means and build a methodology of real practical steps for those who want to shape, maintain and scale resilient "culture" across various size companies.As I don't have all the answers, I will start with what I know from my professional experience as a member of the Development Engagement and Culture team at one of the biggest tech companies in the world. If you are a culture professional, an expert or a leader who sees a value in the core approach - let's work together on building a practical side - steps that individuals, teams and companies can take in order to implement the approach in other organizations.Together we will learn faster and hopefully make the world a better place for many of us.
